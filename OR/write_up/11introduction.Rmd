# Introduction
## Basic Information
This assessment reports the status of `r spp` (*Sebastes miniatus*) off the waters of Oregon state using data through 2020. `r Spp` range from Prince William Sound, Alaska, to central Baja California at depths of 6 m to 436 m [@love_rockfishes_2002]. They are most commonly found from southern Oregon to Punta Baja, Mexico [@Hyde2009] at depths of 50 m to 150 m [@Hyde2009].  Hyde and Vetter [-@Hyde2009] describe an additional cryptic species related to vermilion rockfish, the sunset rockfish (*Sebastes crocotulus*). They note that `r Spp` are residents of shallower depths (<100 m) versus sunset rockfish. Sunset rockfish tend to be more southerly, and are not commonly encountered in Oregon, so this assessment focuses only on `r spp`. Adult fish tend to cluster on high relief rocky outcrops [@love_rockfishes_2002] and kelp forests [@Hyde2009]. North of Point Conception, some adults are shallower, living in caves and cracks [@love_rockfishes_2002]. Vermilion rockfish have shown high site fidelity [@Hannah2011 (only tagged 1 vermilion); @Lea1999], and low average larval dispersal distance [@Hyde2009]. Lowe et al. (2009) [Lowe2009] suggested vermilion rockfish to have a lower site fidelity than previously believed, but they acknowledged that their observations of movements to different depths may have been due to the reality of a shallower species and a deeper species.

The stock designation of Oregon waters was based on the California stock having a separate explotation history as well as a much larger stock density. Vermilion rockfish are not as abundant north of Califoria, but still provide some fishing opportunities [@hannah_age_2012]. The separation of Oregon and Washington into distinct mangement units, and thus separate stock assessments, were based on the observation that most vermilion in Oregon are taken off southern Oregon, while most of the habitat and take of vermilion off Washington was in the very northern portion of the Washington coast (Figure \ref{fig:ORWA-map}). Ninty percent of the total mortality in Oregon is from the southern part of the state (south of Pt. Arago), while ninty-seven percent comes from the northern portion of Washington (Figure \ref{fig:tm-plot}). This large area separation, low movement of larvae and adults, and the biogeographic barriers of the Columbia River outfall and lack of rocky habitat in southern Washington all support separate Oregon-Washington management units.

## Life History 
Approximate lifespan for vermilion rockfish is 60 years, with females living longer and growing larger than their male counterparts. 50% are mature at 5 years and about 37 cm, with males probably maturing at shorter lengths than females [@love_rockfishes_2002].

Vermilion rockfish are viviparous, and release 63,000 to 2,600,000 eggs per season. In southern California, vermilion rockfish larvae are released between July and March. In central and northern California, this release occurs in September, December, and April-June [@love_rockfishes_2002].  In Oregon, fertilized females with ripe ovaries are encountered from April to Ocotber [@hannah_age_2012], with larval release sometime during and after that period. Larval release in fall and winter is not common among other rockfish species. Hyde and Vetter [-@Hyde2009] suggest that low larval dispersal may be due to weak poleward flow of nearshore waters corresponding with peak vermilion larval release. 

Young-of-the-year (YOY) vermilion rockfish settle out of the plankton during two recruitment periods per year, first from February to April and a second from August to October, and settlement has been observed in May off southern California [@love_rockfishes_2002]. There is no information on YOY settlement in Oregon. Larvae measure about 4.3 mm. Both young-of-the-year vermilion and sunset rockfish are mottled brown with areas of black, and older juveniles turn a mottled orange or red color [@Love2012a]. Juvenile fish are found individually from 6 m to 36 m, living near sand and structures. After two months, juveniles travel deeper and live on low relief rocky outcrops and other structures [@love_rockfishes_2002].

Adult vermilion rockfish predominantly eat smaller fish, though sometimes they pursue euphausiids and other various macroplankton [@Phillips1964]. Love [-@love_rockfishes_2002] noted their diet to include octopus, salps, shrimps, and pelagic red crabs.

## Historical and Current Fishery Information
Off the coast of Oregon, vermilion rockfish is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. The landings from the commercial fishery were minimal until the mid-1960s. Following the development of the nearshore commercial fishery in the late 1990s, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) implemented a state-permitted limited access fishery that regulated fleet size, period landing limits and established harvest guidelines [@rodomsky_2019_2020]. Vermilion rockfish is one of multiple rockfish species that are commonly landed as a part of the nearshore commercial groundfish fishery. Currently, this commercial fishery is centered on the southern Oregon coast, where most of the vermilion rockfish commercial landings occur.  Two types of state limited entry permits are issued for this fishery, with and without a nearshore endorsement. Limited entry permit holders without a nearshore endorsement may land commercial quantities of black and blue rockfish under state trip limits, with an additional total of 15 lbs per day of any combination of other nearshore groundfish species and two rockfish species with Federal designation as shelf rockfish. These include tiger and vermilion rockfish. Vessels that have a nearshore endorsement permit may land commercial quantities of other nearshore groundfish species up to the state’s cumulative trip limits and the Federal limits for tiger and vermilion rockfish. There are no state trip limits set for vermilion rockfish. 

This analysis assesses the stock off the Oregon coast as a separate stock from other populations off the West Coast based on the sedentary nature of vermillion rockfish, which likely limits flow of fish between California and Washington. The substrate of the northern Oregon and southern Washington coast is primarily sandy bottom and combined with the Columbia River plume between Oregon and Washington these factors create a natural separation between the Oregon and Washington populations. Additionally, the exploitation history and magnitude of removals off the Oregon coast has been dramatically lower than removals off the California coast. The recreational fishery off the coast of Oregon developed during the 1970s, with the first recorded landings of vermillion rockfish in 1979. Vermilion rockfish is not commonly encountered in the recreational fishery, but recreational removals have generally increased across time as this fishery has developed (Table \ref{tab:Catches_All_Years}).

## Summary of Management History and Performance
Vermilion rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Shelf Rockfish North and Shelf Rockfish South complexes. The North and South areas are split at N. 40°10’ Lat. N. off the West Coast. The complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The OFL and ACL values for the complex are determined by summing the species specific OFLs and ACLs managed within the complex. Removals for species within the Rockfish complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis. The OFL and ACLs for vermilion rockfish North of 40°10’ Lat. N. management area, the state/specific ACL allocation (49 percent for Oregon, Groundfish Management Team, personal communication), and the total removals are shown in Table XX.
